			<h2>Cohort 01 - Madeira</h2>

		<p>
		Madeira. A small archipelago in the middle of the Atlantic. Home of <a
		href="https://www.freemadeira.com/" target="_blank">Free Madeira</a>, home of <a
		href="https://bitcoinatlantis.com/" target="_blank">Bitcoin Atlantis</a>, and
		home of many a bitcoiner. Isolated enough to try something new, connected enough
		to bring everyone together.

					<h3>Beautiful Landscape</h3>
				</header>
				<p>
				Madeira is known for its beautiful landscapes, its rich lore, as well as its
				great food (and legendary wine). We want to explore possibilities, dream, build,
				and get inspired. Gorgeous coastlines and serene levadas are not strictly
				necessary for all that, but they won't hurt either. Maybe we'll even go on a <a
				href="https://plebwalks.com/" target="_blank">#plebwalk</a> or two.

				The first cohort will take place in the <a

				target="_blank"> Sovereign Engineering Shipyard </a> in Funchal, in the heart of
				Madeira. We will meet to discuss, ideate, and build.  You can work solo or in
				teams. The goal is to build something sensible, something new, something that
				lasts. Explore ideas. Explore business models.  Explore possibilities.

				</header>
				<p>
				You might be a 19-year-old hacker straight out of college, but we are not. We
				have kids, we have family, and we do the things we do and build the things we
				build for them, not us. At least not exclusively. Our kids will inherit the
				world that we envision and build for them, so this is not going to be something
				where we lock ourselves into a dark room with dozens of cans of Red Bull until
				we collapse onto our keyboards, but a family affair. If you have kids, bring
				them.
