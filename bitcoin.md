## Fix the Money, Fix the Web

Here's the thing about Bitcoin: it forces you to think about things differently. 

We believe that Bitcoin is the most important thing that's happening in the world, and that fixing the money is a moral imperative.

Bitcoin represents a new paradigm, the paradigm of self-sovereignty and extreme ownership.

It is this paradigm that makes sovereign engineering a necessity. Lyn Alden said it best: "Bitcoin companies don't want your bitcoin. They want you to hold your bitcoin. The whole point of Bitcoin is to avoid counterparty risk." 

Freedom requires responsibility, and we see it as our responsibility to help build tools and companies right, with freedom and self-sovereignty at the core.

We must think about things differently. We must not repeat the mistakes of the past.
