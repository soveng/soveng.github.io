			<h2>Fix the Money, Fix the Web</h2>

		<p>
		Here’s the thing about Bitcoin: it forces you to think about things
		differently.  We believe that Bitcoin is the most important thing that’s
		happening in the world, and that fixing the money is a moral imperative.

					<h3>A New Paradigm</h3>
				</header>
				<p> Bitcoin represents a new paradigm, the paradigm of
				self-sovereignty and extreme ownership.  It is this paradigm
				that makes sovereign engineering a necessity. Lyn Alden said it
				best:
				<blockquote>"Bitcoin companies don’t want your bitcoin.
				They want you to hold your bitcoin. The whole point of Bitcoin
				is to avoid counterparty risk."
				</blockquote>
				The whole point is to put the individual in charge, to put the
				user in control again. With control comes freedom, and with
				freedom comes responsibility.</p>

					<h3 id="responsibility">Responsibility</h3>
				</header>
				<p>
				Freedom requires responsibility, and we see it as our
				responsibility to help build tools and companies right, with
				freedom and self-sovereignty at the core.
				We want to build powerful tools and services, and we want to
				build them right.
				</p>
				<p>
				We believe that we are at a pivotal point in
				history. What we build now will echo in eternity, to paraphrase
				a great emperor. And we take the responsibility of getting it
				right seriously.

				<p>
				In this bright future, we must not forget the past. Why did
				the web evolve the way it evolved? What got captured, what
				didn't? And why? How could it have evolved differently, if
				Bitcoin & Lightning existed 30 years ago? How can we think about
				things differently, now that they do exist?
				</p>
				<p>
				We believe that Bitcoin & Lightning allows us to re-think
				how we build things, how we monetize things, and how we do and
				coordinate things. <a href="/nostr">Nostr</a> is one example. We're sure there are
				many more. Let's explore them together.
