				In the beginning, there was chaos, and potential. And it was

                As time went by, we blindly walked into a homogeneous web, and,
                as such, we colored the world in a pale, safe, boring shade of
                grey. We are here to change that. We are here to un-silo the
                web, to bring back that <s>chaos</s> potential.

				</header>
				<p>
				Nostr is an inkling of what the web could be. The builders and
				early adopters who are pushing the boundaries of this technology
				are bringing back the rainbow of colors and experiences that we
				know and love from the old days.
				</p>
				<p>
				But Nostr is neither nostalgia nor utopia. It is imperfect, and
				messy, and half-baked, and probably can't even survive on its
				own yet. But that's how things are right after birth. But it's
				also growing, and beautiful, and full of potential. And it's
				working.

				</header>
				<p>
				Nostr is a decentralized protocol for exchanging information.
				One of its main attributes is that it does not attempt to lie or
				patronize you and its users.
                What Nostr is exactly is hard to tell at this point in time, but
                we think it is one incredibly likely shot we have at fixing many
                mistakes of the past that have led to the current state of the
                web.

					<h3 id="state">The Current State</h3>
				</header>
				<p>
                The current state is one where the main goal seems to be to
                convince you to buy a certain thing, think a certain thing, or
                get outraged about a certain thing. With, of course, a few
                select individuals sitting at the top and pulling the strings.
                </p>
                <p>
                A state where you and your views can be deemed unacceptable at
                the push of a button, instantly transforming you from a regular
                person enjoying social media to an un-person whose profiles are
                nuked, social connections are lost, and accounts are frozen.

		<p>
		Nostr fixes this. Just like Bitcoin, it is simple but powerful. Just like Bitcoin, it puts the sovereignty of the individual first. Just like Bitcoin, it opens up new possibilities, most of which are yet to be explored. We have barely scratched the surface, so we want to provide an environment to scratch it properly.
