At the beginning there was chaos. And it was good.
But then men created Geocities. And Boostrap. And Twitter. And, oh lord, even Facebook. And Google.
As time went by, we blindly walked into an homogeneous web, and, as such, we coloured the world in a pale, safe, boring shade of grey.
We are here to change that.
We are here to un-silo the web.
To bring back the chaos.
Nostr is that chaos. And you, and us, are the builders bringing back a rainbow of colours and experiences to the web.
Why, how and what is Nostr?
Nostr is a decentralized protocol for exchanging information. One of it's main attributes is that it does not attempt to lie, or patronize you and its users. It's far from perfect, because such is life, such is reality.
But is the one incredibly likely shot we have at fixing the mistakes of the past that has lead to the current state of the world,
where a few individuals can deem you and your dirty views unacceptable. Where the content and the form-factor must be globally palatable, and where the only game that counts is the game of counting followers.
In nostr we don't count followers, not simply because we can't, but because that's not a true measure of your impact nor your reach.
