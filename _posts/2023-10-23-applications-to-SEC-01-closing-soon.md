Applications for the first Sovereign Engineering Cohort in Madeira are closing
soon. But what is the Sovereign Engineering Cohort? That's a great question. We
ask ourselves this question all the time.

We could throw some words at you to try to explain; words like exploration,
ideation, sat-based value flow, and bitcoin standard. We could speak about
[un-siloing the web](/nostr.html) and fixing broken incentives. But we won't.

Here's the thing: we can't tell you what it is exactly. Neither can we tell you
how it's going to be. It's the first of its kind (we think), and we hope it
won't be the last.

The idea is simple: get the best, brightest, and most motivated people in one
place and lock them into a room for two months (figure of speech; there won't be
a room). Give them the tools, the support, and the freedom to build real
solutions to real problems and see what comes out. In terms of projects, apps,
services, teams, and—potentially—businesses.

We believe that the combination of bitcoin (lowercase b, as in sats or money
proper) and nostr (especially the "other stuff") creates a ridiculously exciting
space that is yet to be explored. We like to think of it as the vast open sea,
and we're here to build things, ship things, and chart the waters.

And we don't plan to do it alone. In addition to the 21 participants we are
selecting for the program, we'll invite domain experts from various areas who
will bring various toolkits to the table that, hopefully, will help us all to
not be too foolish in this endeavor.

We want to build things, and we want to build them right. We want to build the
stuff that couldn't have been built before. We want to make the sats flow and
build businesses on top of this flow. And we want you to build it with and
alongside us. We have many amazing participants signed up already, but we still
have a couple of spots left.

**Applications close on October 31.** If all of the above sounds interesting to you,
please apply before this deadline. Applying is as easy as filling out this form:
[https://sovereignengineering.typeform.com/SEC01](https://sovereignengineering.typeform.com/SEC01)

So, what is the Sovereign Engineering Cohort, exactly? We don't know. But I
guess we're going to find out.
