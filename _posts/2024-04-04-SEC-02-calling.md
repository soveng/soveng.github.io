It feels like yesterday when we decided to embark on [the journey that was
SEC-01](/2024/03/20/what-was-SEC-01.html). We
didn’t know what we would get ourselves into. We still barely know. But just
like the guy in the meme, we’re gonna [do it
again](https://i.imgflip.com/38hm3e.png). We’re going to walk the walk, we’re
going to ship things, and we’re going to have a good time while doing it.

We expect a lot of experimentation, discussion, and exploration. We expect that
SEC-02 will rhyme with SEC-01, even though it won’t be a carbon copy of the
first cohort. We’d encourage you to listen to [this Plebchain Radio
episode](https://pod.link/1691033484/episode/c6b8fad1df63e5300c9dc543bf54b201)
and (the end of) [this Citadel Dispatch
episode](https://pod.link/1546393840/episode/7d6168eeaac1edbd1d54d8b0a8c554dc)
to get an idea of what we’re aiming for.

## Scratching the Surface

Our thesis remains the same: The space that is opened up by Bitcoin, nostr, and
other freedom tech is vast. We believe that we have barely scratched the
surface. We believe that lots of awesome stuff is yet to be built, and we
believe that the new paradigms will allow us to step outside of the extractive
models that are so prevalent in the current landscape.

If you believe the same, you might be a perfect candidate for the second
cohort—and you should [apply
today](https://sovereignengineering.typeform.com/SEC02).

## Markets, Synergies, and Peers

As foreshadowed in a [previous
post](/2024/03/20/what-was-SEC-01.html#sec-02-whats-ahead),
we want to focus on peer-to-peer markets and exchange. With nostr acting as an
effective and open layer for discoverability, and sats (and
[esats](https://github.com/cashubtc/awesome-cashu)) acting as a bearer
instrument for final settlement, what used to be siloed marketplaces can finally
be opened up to merchants and customers alike.

It allows us to move from the win-lose of zero-sum games to the win-win-win of
positive-sum games: good for you, good for me, good for the environment. In one
word: Synergies.

We hope that the various peers that are working on these markets—as well as the
building blocks that make them possible—will collaborate and learn from each
other, just like they did in the first cohort. And even if your expertise is
tangential, we hope that novel insights, products, and services will come out of
it all. Just like [they did in the first
cohort](/2024/03/19/what-came-out-of-SEC-01.html).

That’s the basic idea of the Sovereign Engineering cohorts: Explore the unknown.
Re-think how we do things online. Ship things that last.

## Starting May 6 — Apply Now!

The second cohort will start on May 6 and will conclude on June 28, and just
like the first one, it will be on the beautiful island of Madeira.
**Applications are closing soon**, but we still have a couple of spots left.
