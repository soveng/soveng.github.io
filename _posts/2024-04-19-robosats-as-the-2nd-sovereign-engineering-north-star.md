The future we're heading towards will have many bots, that much seems clear. But
not all bots have to be bad bots. We'll probably have good bots too. Useful
bots. Economic bots. As well as humans that turn themselves into bots, when
appropriate (or necessary).

We are pleased to have [RoboSats][gh] as our North Star for the second Sovereign
Engineering Cohort.

As the focus of the second cohort is on P2P markets and exchanges, we are
excited to learn from their execution and architecture and get insights into the
thought process that led to theÂ building of RoboSats.

Just like in the [previous cohort][mutiny], the North Star shall act as a guiding light,
as something to look up to. Having experienced veterans of the RoboSats team
join the cohort is fantastic, as everyone can learn from them, ourselves
included.

There is still a little bit of time left. If you want to spend some weeks with
doers and builders, [apply today!][tf] Applications will close on the 21st.
