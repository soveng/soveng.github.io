Some of the things that came out of (or saw further development during) SEC-01 are already live:

- [npub.cash](https://npub.cash/) ([code](https://github.com/cashubtc/npubcash-server), [article](https://yakihonne.com/article/naddr1qvzqqqr4gupzpk9zcvljutln482072j4j0eatfv7j9nl5h0dqc7sujvfzamxz8svqq2hx733vdfngefjvatygwtyde555wpdga95utj9ftv))

A lot of the projects that participants worked on or came up with have a strong
focus on DVMs...

- [Nostr-DVM-Kit](https://github.com/nourspace/nostr-dvm-kit)

...as well as developer tooling...

- [nostrocket](https://nostrocket.org/) ([code](https://github.com/nostrocket))

Many more things are still in the making:

- [nostr-geotags](https://github.com/sandwichfarm/nostr-geotags)
- [featurestr-bountiestr](https://github.com/sebdeveloper6952/featurestr-bountiestr)

And if my Spidey senses are to be
trusted, a lot more things will come out of the conversations that were had in
the last 2 months. Keep an eye out for:

- `ghole.xyz`
- `pubkey.studio`
- `pubkey.land`

...and other weird stuff.

Turns out you can actually re-invent the future if you put [21 guinea pigs on a
pirate ship](/2024/03/20/what-was-SEC-01.html).
