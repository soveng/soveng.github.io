### When does the first Sovereign Engineering Cohort start?

If you are selected for SEC-01, we expect and welcome you on Monday **January 8th**
2024 at 9am.  
  
### Where does the Sovereign Engineering Cohort take place?

At [Cowork
Funchal](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/3947240594#map=19/32.65134/-16.91158),
which is located in the capital of Madeira, an island in the Atlantic Ocean and
part of Portugal.  
  
Address: Rua das Mercês 29, 9000-224 Funchal, Portugal

### Is this a free program?

Yes, it is. If you are selected, the SEC-01 program is free for you. We’ll take
care of the working space, and make sure you feel at home. This location will be
our homebase until Demo Day on Friday the 1st of March, when we’ll showcase our
projects during [Bitcoin Atlantis](https://bitcoinatlantis.com).  

You are more than welcome to stay for this conference for which you’ll receive a
free pass from us. Grant yourself some time off afterwards to relax and enjoy
the island, if you can.  
  
### Do you pay for flights and accommodation?

No, we don’t. If you commit yourself to SEC-01 you have to organize your flights
and accommodation yourself. If you, for any reason, are not able to do this,
send us a message via the [contact
form](#contact).
  
### Do you provide accommodation?

No, but you can search for a roof over your head on:

- [https://nomadlist.com/madeira](https://nomadlist.com/madeira)
- [https://www.anislandapart.com](https://www.anislandapart.com)
- [https://www.booking.com](https://www.booking.com)
- [https://www.airbnb.com](https://www.airbnb.com)

There's also [madeirafriends.org](https://madeirafriends.org) which is a
community that can help with many things.

### How do I need to prepare for the two months?

There’s of course a difference if you travel to Madeira on your own, or with a
family. Besides this, your preparations should be approached like a longer than
normal working holiday of two months. So, pack enough clothes and hardware that
you’ll be needing for living out of your suitcase for a while.  
  
If you have special needs, please send us a message through the
[contact form](#contact) and we’ll see how we can help you settle in.  
  
### What is the cost of living in Madeira?

If you are invited to come after you’re selected into SEC-01, you need to take
care of a personal budget for 2 months, including flight tickets, rent for
accommodation, spending money for daily expenses such as breakfast, lunch and
dinner. Pocket money for the weekend outings is also not a bad idea, since
you’ll be able to explore beautiful Madeira once you’re there.  
  
A so-called ballpark figure is hard to calculate in general, as Madeira might be
cheaper for participants who come from the US or north-west Europe. If you come
from southern Europe or Asia or the Americas it might be more expensive. Besides
this it also depends on your personal preferences for accommodation, etc.
