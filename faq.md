### When does the next Sovereign Engineering Cohort start?

If you are selected for SEC-03, we expect and welcome you on Monday **Oct 14th**
2024 at 9am.

### Where does the Sovereign Engineering Cohort take place?

At [Cowork
Funchal](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/3947240594#map=19/32.65134/-16.91158),
which is located in the capital of Madeira, an island in the Atlantic Ocean and
part of Portugal.  
  
Address: Rua das Mercês 29, 9000-224 Funchal, Portugal

### Is this a free program?

Yes, it is. If you are selected, the program is free for you. We’ll take care of
the shared coworking space and make sure you feel at home. This location will be
our homebase until the final Demo Day.

That said, we are not going to work 24/7. Grant yourself some time off after our
working sessions to relax and enjoy the island.  
  
### Do you pay for flights and accommodation?

No, we don’t. If you commit yourself to the program you have to organize your
flights and accommodation yourself. If you, for any reason, are not able to do
this, please send us a message via the [contact form](#contact).
  
### Do you provide accommodation?

No, but you can search for a roof over your head on:

- [https://nomadlist.com/madeira](https://nomadlist.com/madeira)
- [https://www.anislandapart.com](https://www.anislandapart.com)
- [https://www.booking.com](https://www.booking.com)
- [https://www.airbnb.com](https://www.airbnb.com)

There's also [madeirafriends.org](https://madeirafriends.org) which is a
community that can help with many things.

### How do I need to prepare for the eight weeks?

There’s of course a difference if you travel to Madeira on your own, or with a
family. Besides this, your preparations should be approached like a longer than
normal working holiday of eight weeks. So, pack enough clothes and hardware that
you’ll be needing for living out of your suitcase for a while.  
  
If you have special needs, please send us a message through the
[contact form](#contact) and we’ll see how we can help you settle in.  
  
### What is the cost of living in Madeira?

If you are invited to come after you’re selected, you need to take care of a
personal budget for 8 weeks, including flight tickets, rent for accommodation,
spending money for daily expenses such as breakfast, lunch and dinner. Pocket
money for the weekend outings is also not a bad idea, since you’ll be able to
explore beautiful Madeira once you’re there.  
  
A so-called ballpark figure is hard to calculate in general, as Madeira might be
cheaper for participants who come from the US or north-west Europe. If you come
from southern Europe or Asia or the Americas it might be more expensive. Besides
this it also depends on your personal preferences for accommodation, etc.
