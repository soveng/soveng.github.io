                    Pablo is the developer behind many Nostr applications, most notably
                    <a href="https://highlighter.com/" target="_blank">Highlighter</a>
                    &

                    target="_blank">NDK</a>. His upbringing in ever-chaotic
                    Argentina taught him the urgency of building tools and
                    parallel systems that are resistant to the state and, more
                    importantly, transcend the limited and limiting mental
                    models that are downstream from its constraints. Formerly
                    Head of R&D at Swan, he is now fully focused on
                    exploring Nostr’s “and other stuff” with an R&D lens.

                    André is our local Madeiran, serial doer, and father of four.
                    He takes care of the fiat side of things and is our local
                    connector. He soon found out that working for other people
                    was not ideal and ventured into a diversified portfolio of
                    private businesses, as for example, <em>Cowork Funchal</em>, the
                    first coworking space of Funchal, the main city in Madeira
                    Island and <em>An Island Apart</em>, the biggest holiday rental
                    management company in the archipelago. Bitcoin infects the
                    mind, so now some of his other (ad)ventures include Monstera
                    Media, Basalto Investments, and, most recognizable, being the
                    founder of <a href="https://www.freemadeira.com/" target="_blank">FREE
                    Madeira</a> and responsible for <a

                MW is a fiat refugee, fleeing clown world in mainland EU. His dedication to the
                Bitcoin Standard is absolute, and he's fully committed to contribute to shaping
                a better world <a href="https://nostr.band/?q=%23forthekids" target="_blank">#forthekids</a>.
                Looking back on 20+ years of experience as an entrepreneur in
                the digital agency industry, MW has skilled-up dozens of
                developers, being the founder of The App Academy, and worked
                with lots of startups and growth companies alike.
                
                Now venturing into the heart of lightness on Madeira with
                Sovereign Engineering, he's convinced we're witnessing the
                beginning of a new era, and this time we have to do it right.
                This second chance is all we'll ever get: to recreate the web
                with freedom technology, as it is supposed to be, for all the
                people in the world and their future prosperity.
