                    Pablo is the developer behind many Nostr applications, most notably

                    &

                    target="_blank">NDK</a>. His upbringing in ever-chaotic
                    Argentina taught him the urgency of building tools and
                    parallel systems that are resistant to the state and, more
                    importantly, transcend the limited and limiting mental
                    models that are downstream from its constraints. Formerly
                    Head of R&D at SwanBitcoin, he is now fully focused on
                    exploring Nostr’s “and other stuff” with an R&D lens.

                    André is our local Madeiran, serial doer and father of four.
                    He takes care of the fiat side of things and is our local
                    connector. He soon found out that working for other people
                    was not ideal and ventured into a diversified portfolio of
                    private businesses, as for example, <em>Cowork Funchal</em>, the
                    first coworking space of Funchal, the main city in Madeira
                    Island and <em>An Island Apart</em>, the biggest holiday rental
                    management company in the archipelago. Bitcoin infects the
                    mind, so now some of his other (ad)ventures include Monstera
                    Media, Basalto Investments and, most recognizable, being the
                    founder of <a href="https://www.freemadeira.com/">FREE
                    Madeira</a> and responsible for <a

                This second chance is all we'll ever get, to recreate the web
