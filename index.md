This is not a conference. This is not a hackathon. Neither is this a school, or
an academy, or a workshop. This is something else. Something new, something more
dynamic. The goal of the **Sovereign Engineering Cohort** is to bring the best
and brightest---the ones with the brightest fire burning inside, those who have
not given up on the Web or the world---together in a beautiful place for a
prolonged period of time.

Explore the unknown. Re-think how we do things online. Ship things that last.

The vast and endless sea is the ocean of possibilities that bitcoin & nostr open
up. The ships are the tools we're going to build; the wood is the software we're
going to write.
